When it looked like Tiger Woods' 20-foot putt for birdie on No. 15 during Sunday's final round at the AT&T National would miss, the 14-time major champion simply gave his golf ball directions with his left hand -- and it cooperated. Fittingly, he then pointed one finger to the sky, fully knowing what would happen next as the ball took its final few rotations before tumbling into the hole. 

That guy who always seemed to conjure up magic at the right time? Well, he seems to have returned. And no matter what the computers say, he's No. 1 again.

Seriously, who's better? If you had to bet your life on the winner of the upcoming British Open, who would you take? Rory "MC"ilroy? Luke "Wake me up when he contends at a major" Donald? Lee "Top-3 finish" Westwood? 

Strictly on talent, McIlroy has the strongest claim to Woods' throne. But whether it's a high-profile relationship or increased scrutiny, he's also struggled to maintain the same consistent level he enjoyed earlier this season. Westwood, with a bunch of high finishes in majors the past four years, is the safest argument. But his major "drought" is even longer than Tiger's -- as in, it has lasted his whole life. Also, it's tough to take serious someone who has fewer PGA Tour wins in his career than Woods has in his last seven starts.

That's three high-quality wins in seven tournaments. Since Tiger won six PGA Tour events in 2009, only one player, Jim Furyk in 2010, has even matched that total for an entire season. And he hasn't done it with smoke and mirrors. Woods has been near the top or at the top in total driving and greens all year and he even ranks 14th in strokes gained-putting. Most importantly, he leads the tour in scoring average. At this rate, winning more majors shouldn't just be expected, it's inevitable. After all, that's what the best player in the world is supposed to do.
