Arkush: Woods can't be No. 1 until he proves it in majors

Tiger Woods is definitely back -- back to playing exceptional golf on some of the game's most demanding layouts (Bay Hill, Muirfield Village, Congressional). In each of those marquee events, when it mattered most, Woods was his old self. No wonder many observers are rushing to put him once again on the throne he occupied for well over a decade.

Not so fast. While Woods certainly deserves the praise -- there were some who were skeptical that he would come back this far -- he does not deserve to be considered the best player in the world. Not yet. Not till he wins a major or, at the very least, comes close.

Despite his recent success, there is some lingering doubt about Woods, which is what distinguishes this particular version from the one we took for granted. There was no doubt about the earlier version. That version would not bogey the par-5 16th at Congressional with the tournament hanging in the balance. That version would not go eight over on the weekend at Olympic.

Are we perhaps establishing a higher standard for Woods than we did with Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy, the three most recent players to occupy the No. 1 spot? Yes, and justifiably so. It is Woods, after all, who set such a high standard, with his play and his demeanor. He judges his status in the game by his performance in the majors. We must judge him the same way.

Woods could win the Greenbrier Classic this week by five strokes, and it would not matter. What matters is what he does at Royal Lytham and St. Annes, and at Kiawah.
